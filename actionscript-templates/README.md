actionscript-templates
========================
If you choose to use one of these actionscript templates, you will need to pay
attention to the following notes.

Compilation Notes
========================

1) The class name and the function name must match the prefix of the filename:
   If the filename is test1.as, you need to edit test1.as file and change
   the class name and function name to test1, which is shown below:

```actionscript
 public class test1 extends Sprite {
  public function test1() {
```

2) The command to complile the actionscript into a SWF is:
```
/opt/flex/bin/mxmlc test1.as --output /[webroot]/crossdomain/test1.swf
```

3) Lastly, you will want to configure your HTML launcher file to load the
   correct SWF.  Because the SWF and html file are in the same directory
   you don't need to add the path.

```html
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="test1.swf" width="1" height="1"> 
    <param name="movie" value="test1.swf" />
```
